# Cloud Network
This repository is a collection of ansible playbooks and a network diagram that depict the ELK-Stack I created.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with differnt docker containers.

The final setup was 2 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
